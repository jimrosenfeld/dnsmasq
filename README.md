# DNSMasq

Install and configure dnsmasq. Depends on the [hosts_file cookbook](https://github.com/hw-cookbooks/hosts_file).

# Recipes

## default
Installs the `dnsmasq` package. Depending on the `[:dnsmasq][:enable_dns]` and `[:dnsmasq][:enable_dhcp]` attributes it includes the `dns` and `dhcp` recipes respectively.

## dhcp

Includes the `default` recipe and writes the contents of the `node[:dnsmasq][:dhcp]` attribute hash to `/etc/dnsmasq.d/dhcp.conf`. Here is an example of the necessary attributes for DHCP with TFTP enabled:

```ruby
'dnsmasq' => {
  'enable_dhcp' => true,
  'dhcp' => {
    'dhcp-authoritative' => nil,
    'dhcp-range' => 'eth0,10.0.0.10,10.0.0.100,12h',
    'dhcp-option' => '3', #turns off everything except basic DHCP
    'domain' => 'lab.atx',
    'interface' => 'eth0',
    'dhcp-boot' => 'pxelinux.0',
    'enable-tftp' => nil,
    'tftp-root' => '/var/lib/tftpboot',
    'tftp-secure' => nil
  }
}
```

## Docker / Other virtualization

Some virtualization platforms such as docker handle security and permissions differently. dnsmasq does not have the ability to access NET_CAP_ADMIN in recent virtualization platforms, which is required for DHCP (this can cause dnsmasq to fail even when dhcp is not being used due to how it is loaded in memory). 

A simple fix for this is to add the following to your attributes:

```ruby
default['dnsmasq']['dhcp']['user'] = 'root'
```

or

```ruby
'dnsmasq' => {
  'dhcp' => {
    'user' => 'root'
  }
}
```

## dns

Includes the `default` and `manage_hostsfile` recipes, then writes the content of the `node[:dnsmasq][:dns]` attribute hash to `/etc/dnsmasq.d/dns.conf`.

## manage_hostsfile

Loads the `dnsmasq` data bag `managed_hosts` item and merges it with any nodes in the `[:dnsmasq][:managed_hosts]` attribute, then writes them out to `/etc/hosts/` via the `hosts_file` cookbook.

# Usage

## Data Bag

If you need manage your DNS hosts you may use the `dnsmasq` data bag `managed_hosts` item. It takes the form:

```json
{
    "id": "managed_hosts",
    "maps": {
      "192.168.0.100": "www.google.com",
      "192.168.0.101": ["www.yahoo.com", "www.altavista.com"]
    }
}
```

## Attributes

* `[:dnsmasq][:enable_dns]` whether to enable the DNS service, default is `true`
* `[:dnsmasq][:enable_dhcp]` whether to enabled the DHCP service, default is `false`
* `[:dnsmasq][:managed_hosts]` hash of IPs and hostname/array of hostnames for the `manage_hostfile` recipe, default is empty
* `[:dnsmasq][:managed_hosts_bag]` name of the data bag item, default is `managed_hosts`
* `[:dnsmasq][:dhcp]` = hash of settings and values for the `/etc/dnsmasq.d/dhcp.conf`, default is empty
* `[:dnsmasq][:dhcp_options]` = list of options to be added to the `/etc/dnsmasq.d/dhcp.conf` (ie. `['dhcp-host=80:ee:73:0a:fa:d9,crushinator,10.0.0.11']`), default is empty.
* `[:dnsmasq][:dns]` hash of settings and values for the `/etc/dnsmasq.d/dns.conf`, defaults are
```ruby
{
  'no-poll' => nil,
  'no-resolv' => nil,
  'server' => '127.0.0.1'
}
```
* `[:dnsmasq][:dns_options]` = list of options to be added to the `/etc/dnsmasq.d/dns.conf`, default is empty.
